Database configuration and helper functions.

This module sets up the asynchronous SQLAlchemy engine and session
factory.  The database connection URL is read from the ``DATABASE_URL``
environment variable.  A simple table creation helper is also provided
to initialise the schema at application startup when using SQLite or
when migrations have not yet been applied.
