"""
ORM model definitions for the Luna backend.

This module defines the ``User`` and ``Message`` models used to
persist chat history and user data in a relational database.  The
models use SQLAlchemy's declarative syntax and are designed to be
loaded asynchronously via the engine configured in
``fastapi_app.db``.
